Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has long been a subject of fascination within the field of Machine Learning, finally, it's now within reach thanks to groundbreaking advancements happening every day (literally). New AI projects are being grown from the seed level to big organizations in order to solve a few critical problems which we never knew existed; most importantly for which we couldn't find solutions for, *yet*.

Critical problems that Developers and Data Scientists/Engineers face on a day-to-day basis while developing ML models are:

* **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: Developing Machine Learning models from scratch can be cumbersome and time-consuming; which we don't have, we need to move fast.
    
* **Less Support for External Integrations:** ML models often need integrations to work seamlessly, to ingest data from a datasource, to store data into Data storages, etc. This may become an overhead.
    
* **Non-Interpretable Models & Poor Data Preprocessing:** Models like neural networks are considered *black boxes* as it can be challenging to understand the decision-making process involved while making predictions especially when the data is not cleaned/preprocessed properly.
    
* **Model Overfitting & Scaling Issues:** Overfitting is one of the most common pain points while training ML models, because of the lack of optimization of a model; The model can present false results, or sometimes scalability can be an issue.
    

All of these problems which we discussed are being solved by an innovative platform **MindsDB.** MindsDB aims to revolutionize the way we approach and process data. It provides simple yet powerful tools by offering an automated approach, reducing the effort of selecting algorithms, finetuning hyperparameters, and handling feature engineering. MindsDB offers **100+** data integrations, for you to work blazingly fast in shipping your ML models. Moreover, it focuses on providing interpretable models along with automating certains aspects of data preprocessing, and techniques to mitigate overfitting, in turn improving the overall performance on unseen data. MindsDB is a one-stop solution for all your ML problems.

Let us dive deep into the capabilities of MindsDB, and have a hands-on experience on how this technology can help us unlock the full potential of Machine Learning.
