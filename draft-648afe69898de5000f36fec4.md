Here is the end goal for this tutorial: A personal chatbot using the Slack Connector from MindsDB, OpenAI's GPT-4.

Background about MindsDB:

MindsDB is a famous open-source application used for simplifying the use of Machine Learning in modern-day applications without the need for any external tool by making forecasts on the Data available in your database. It lets you build any Generative AI application with minimal steps required.

Let's continue with the tutorial and see how we can make our customized Slack chatbot

To get started:

* Create an account on the MindsDB cloud (if you're new)
    
* Go to the MindsDB Editor
    

Let's get our hands dirty by building GPT-4 Model, let's see how we can achieve this.

## Scripting GPT-4 Model:

Alright, let's dive into the tutorial and have fun creating our very own Slack chatbot!

First things first:

1\. Sign up for a MindsDB cloud account (if you're new to it) 2. Head over to the MindsDB Editor

Now, let's roll up our sleeves and start building the GPT-4 Model together. Here's how we can do it:

## Crafting the GPT-4 Model:

Generating a GPT model with MindsDB feels like taking a thrilling elevator ride in Burj Khalifa (You don't realize, you made it)!

Here we will be `gpt_model` to our GPT-4 Model.

Note: OpenAI API is in HIGH demand and is rate limited, you might experience some delays in getting responses.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.gpt_model
PREDICT response
USING
engine = 'openai',
-- api_key = 'your openai key', -- in MindsDB cloud accounts we provide a default key 
model_name = 'gpt-4', -- you can also use 'text-davinci-003' or 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
prompt_template = 'respond to {{text}} sent by {{author_username}}';
```

Note: If you are using MindsDB on Docker or if you want to use your own OpenAI API Key, simply remove `--` from `api_key` argument.

The critical attribute here is `prompt_template` where we tell the GPT model, how to respond to the questions asked by the user, feel free to change any values passed in the columns, from our example, `{{text}}` and `{{author_username}}`, will be replaced by the `WHERE` clause provided in the query. Let's see how it works:

```sql
SELECT response
FROM mindsdb.gpt_model
WHERE author_username = "mindsdb"
AND text = "What would happen if humans could photosynthesize like plants?";
```

## Feeding Personality into Our Model

Alright, so the old model's replies were kind of meh. But hey, we can use some prompt template tricks to make it respond the way we want. We just got to tell GPT in simple words how we want it to answer.

Now, let's make a model called whizfizz\_model with a prompt template that gives GPT a wild personality that eludes a playful and magical aura. Imagine scientific knowledge with whimsical storytelling to create a unique and enchanting experience. We'll call him **WhizFizz**:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.whizfizz_model
PREDICT response
USING
engine = 'openai',
max_tokens = 300,
-- api_key = 'your openai key, -- in MindsDB cloud accounts we provide a default key
model_name = 'gpt-4', -- you can also use 'text-davinci-003' or 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
prompt_template = "From input message: {{text}}\
by from_user: {{author_username}}\
write a short response to {{author_username}} in the following format:\
Dear @{{author_username}}, WhizFizz here! Let's dive into the cosmic abyss, where wonders persist. From stars that explode with flair to galaxies beyond compare. To explore further, check out 'The Elegant Universe' by Brian Greene, a mind-bending OG read. And for mind-blowing quantum tales, 'Alice in Quantumland' by Robert Gilmore is where curiosity prevails. So let's embark on a journey, where science and magic intertwine. Stay tuned for more enchantment! âœ¨ðŸš€ -- mdb.ai/bot by @mindsdb";
```

Let's test this in action:

```sql
SELECT response
FROM mindsdb.whizfizz_model
WHERE author_username = "someuser" 
AND text = "@whizfizz, what would happen if humans could photosynthesize like plants?";
```

You see the difference! Now, I'm getting excited, let's try again.

```sql
SELECT response
FROM mindsdb.whizfizz_model
WHERE author_username = "someuser" 
AND text = "@whizfizz, if a time-traveling astronaut had a dance-off with a black hole, what mind-bending moves would they showcase, and how would gravity groove to the rhythm?!";
```

```sql
SELECT response
FROM mindsdb.whizfizz_model
WHERE author_username = "someuser"
AND text = "@whizfizz, if the laws of physics took a vacation for a day, what hilarious chaos would ensue in our gravity-defying universe?";
```

## Let's Connect this to Slack

To connect our WhizFizz model to Slack workspace we need Slack API Token. You can follow this [Tutorial](https://hashnode.com/preview/6490d6bac3eed8000f25bdf6) to get the API Token
